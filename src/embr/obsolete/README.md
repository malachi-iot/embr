# dataport & datapump

I have moved this in here because it has always been complicated to use and understand, almost prohibitively so.

The idea itself is still compelling a queue + transport wrapper (when combined
with datapump)

It's conceivable we might bring this back someday - particularly dataport which is a less
complicated building block on which datapump is based
